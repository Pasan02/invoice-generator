## 🚀 Future Enhancements: Advanced Options

| Requirement ID | Description                          | User Story                                                                 | Expected Behaviour / Outcome                                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RQ-023         | Invoice Status Indicators            | As a user, I want to set an invoice status (paid, unpaid, overdue, draft) to better track payments. | A toggle in advanced options enables status selection, which appears as a color-coded indicator on the invoice and PDF. |
| RQ-024         | Custom Color Themes                  | As a user, I want to customize the color scheme of my invoices to match my brand. | Advanced options panel provides a color picker with presets (indigo, blue, emerald, purple, rose) that changes the invoice accent colors. |
| RQ-025         | Custom Footer Text                   | As a user, I want to personalize the footer message on my invoices. | Text fields in advanced options allow customizing the thank you message and brand/company name in the footer. |
| RQ-026         | Advanced Options Panel               | As a user, I want a dedicated place for less commonly used settings without cluttering the main form. | A floating "Advanced Options" button in the corner opens a modal with additional customization settings. |

These advanced features would be implemented with:

1. A floating panel accessible from the main form interface
2. Settings saved to localStorage for persistence across sessions
3. Real-time preview updates when options are changed
4. Integration with the PDF generation pipeline to reflect customizations
5. Default values for all options to ensure the basic experience remains clean and simple

Implementation priority would be lower than core invoice functionality but would provide valuable personalization options for power users.
